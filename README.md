# Magic Square Game

# Overview

The Magic Square Game is an interactive puzzle where the player must arrange numbers in a grid such that the sums of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal are all the same. This project features a responsive UI with both light and dark modes, and additional gameplay features like time tracking, scorekeeping, and hints.

## Features

- **Grid Customization**: Choose from 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5 grids to challenge yourself with different levels of difficulty.

- **Light and Dark Mode**: Easily switch between light and dark modes using the toggle button in the top right corner.

- **Time Tracking**: Keep track of how long it takes to solve the puzzle.

- **Scorekeeping**: Start with a score of 100 points, and lose points for each hint you use.

- **Hints**: Need a little help? Use the hint feature to get guidance, but bewareâ€”it will cost you points!

## How to Play

- **Start the Game**: Select your desired grid size (3x3, 4x4, or 5x5) and click the "Start Game" button to generate the grid.
  
- **Arrange the Numbers**: Fill the grid with numbers from 1 to n^2 (where n is the grid size) in such a way that the sum of numbers in each row, column, and diagonal equals the magic constant.
  
- **Check Your Work**: Once you think you've solved the puzzle, click the "Check" button to see if you've created a valid magic square.
  
- **Use Hints**: If you're stuck, click the "Hint" button for assistance (note that this will reduce your score).
  
- **Watch the Clock**: The timer will start as soon as you begin and will stop once you've successfully completed the magic square.
